# Toto fonts
This repository hosts “last good” (from my perspective) versions of Google’s [Noto fonts](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/) from September 23, 2015, which were published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). After that date, the license was changed to OFL, along with a few other Apache 2-licensed Google fonts (Droid and Open Sans). The Apache 2 license allows very flexible creation of derivative works, while the OFL license is more copyleft and prohibits certain use cases. 

The fonts are grouped by the ISO 15924 script codes dominent in each font’s glyph repertoire.
