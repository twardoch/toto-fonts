# Toto fonts
“Last good” i.e. Apache 2-licensed versions of the [Noto fonts](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/) from Sep 23, 2015. After that date, the license was changed to OFL. 

The Noto fonts in this repository are published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). On Sep 23, 2015, newer versions of the [Noto fonts](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/) were published under the OFL license, but since the Apache 2 license is more permissive, I’m hosting the Apache 2-licensed fonts here. 

The fonts are grouped by their main ISO 15924 script codes.
