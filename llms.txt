      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

# Toto Fonts Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

The toto-fonts project is a valuable repository of Google Noto fonts from before their license change to OFL. While functional, the codebase requires modernization, better organization, and improved deployment capabilities. This plan outlines comprehensive improvements to make the project more stable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Preserves historically important Apache 2.0 licensed versions of Noto fonts
- Functional font merging system using fontTools
- Organized directory structure by script and weight
- Basic automation through shell scripts

### Weaknesses
- Outdated Python code (Python 3 shebang but uses Python 2 constructs like `unicode()`)
- Missing dependency management (no requirements.txt or setup.py)
- No error handling or validation in scripts
- Limited documentation for users and developers
- No CI/CD pipeline or automated testing
- Hardcoded paths and assumptions about directory structure
- Missing proper logging and debugging capabilities
- No versioning system for merged fonts

## Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Code Modernization and Stability

#### 1.1 Python Compatibility Updates
- **Problem**: The code contains Python 2 constructs (e.g., `unicode()` in merge_noto.py:943) despite Python 3 shebangs
- **Solution**: 
  - Audit all Python scripts for Python 2/3 compatibility issues
  - Replace `unicode()` with proper string handling
  - Use `pathlib` for file path operations instead of string concatenation
  - Add type hints for better code clarity and IDE support
  - Ensure consistent use of Python 3.8+ features

#### 1.2 Dependency Management
- **Problem**: No explicit dependency tracking, making setup difficult
- **Solution**:
  - Create `requirements.txt` with pinned versions:
    ```
    fonttools==4.x.x
    pyyaml==6.x.x
    nototools==0.x.x
    ```
  - Create `setup.py` for proper package installation
  - Add `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
  - Document Python version requirements

#### 1.3 Error Handling and Validation
- **Problem**: Scripts fail silently or with cryptic errors
- **Solution**:
  - Add comprehensive try-except blocks with meaningful error messages
  - Validate input files exist before processing
  - Check font file integrity before merging
  - Implement rollback mechanisms for failed merges
  - Add progress indicators for long-running operations

### Phase 2: Architecture and Design Improvements

#### 2.1 Modular Design
- **Problem**: Monolithic scripts with mixed concerns
- **Solution**:
  - Extract font merging logic into a reusable library
  - Separate configuration from code
  - Create abstract base classes for font processors
  - Implement plugin architecture for custom merge strategies

#### 2.2 Configuration Management
- **Problem**: Hardcoded paths and settings scattered throughout code
- **Solution**:
  - Create `config.yaml` or `config.ini` for all settings
  - Support environment variables for deployment flexibility
  - Implement configuration validation
  - Add configuration templates and examples

#### 2.3 Logging and Monitoring
- **Problem**: Limited visibility into operations
- **Solution**:
  - Replace print statements with proper logging
  - Implement configurable log levels
  - Add structured logging for better parsing
  - Create log rotation policies
  - Add performance metrics collection

### Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance

#### 3.1 Unit Testing
- **Problem**: No automated tests
- **Solution**:
  - Create test suite using pytest
  - Add unit tests for all core functions
  - Implement fixtures for test font files
  - Achieve >80% code coverage

#### 3.2 Integration Testing
- **Problem**: No validation of merged font quality
- **Solution**:
  - Test complete merge workflows
  - Validate merged font properties
  - Check character coverage preservation
  - Verify metrics consistency

#### 3.3 Continuous Integration
- **Problem**: No automated quality checks
- **Solution**:
  - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
  - Run tests on multiple Python versions
  - Add linting with flake8/black
  - Implement security scanning
  - Create automated release process

### Phase 4: Documentation and User Experience

#### 4.1 User Documentation
- **Problem**: Minimal usage instructions
- **Solution**:
  - Create comprehensive README with:
    - Quick start guide
    - Installation instructions
    - Usage examples
    - Troubleshooting section
  - Add inline code documentation
  - Create API documentation with Sphinx
  - Add example configurations

#### 4.2 Developer Documentation
- **Problem**: No contribution guidelines
- **Solution**:
  - Create CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Document code architecture
  - Add development setup guide
  - Create coding standards document

### Phase 5: Deployment and Distribution

#### 5.1 Packaging
- **Problem**: No easy distribution method
- **Solution**:
  - Create pip-installable package
  - Add Dockerfile for containerized deployment
  - Create platform-specific installers
  - Publish to PyPI

#### 5.2 Web Interface
- **Problem**: Command-line only interface
- **Solution**:
  - Create simple Flask/FastAPI web UI
  - Add drag-and-drop font upload
  - Implement real-time merge progress
  - Provide download links for merged fonts

#### 5.3 Pre-built Fonts
- **Problem**: Users must merge fonts themselves
- **Solution**:
  - Create GitHub releases with pre-merged fonts
  - Implement automated nightly builds
  - Provide CDN hosting for web fonts
  - Create npm package for web developers

### Phase 6: Advanced Features

#### 6.1 Font Optimization
- **Problem**: Merged fonts can be large

# Toto fonts
This repository hosts “last good” (from my perspective) versions of Google’s [Noto fonts](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/) from September 23, 2015, which were published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). After that date, the license was changed to OFL, along with a few other Apache 2-licensed Google fonts (Droid and Open Sans). The Apache 2 license allows very flexible creation of derivative works, while the OFL license is more copyleft and prohibits certain use cases. 

The fonts are grouped by style, then by the ISO 15924 script codes dominant in each font’s glyph repertoire.
